# Detect counterfeit banknotes with logistic regression

This project was completed as a part of the [Data Analyst nanodegree](https://openclassrooms.com/en/dashboard/paths) displayed by Openclassrooms. 


_At OpenClassrooms, the learning process is project-driven to ensure proficiency and get some hands-on experiences. 
The Data Analyst degree include 9 projects to get through all the fundamentals of the Data Analyst Role._

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression.
