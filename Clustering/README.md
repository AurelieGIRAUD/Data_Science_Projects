This project includes the following steps:

  1) Data Cleaning
  
  - Handling outliers
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Check correlations and distributions
  - Log-transformation


  2) Clustering 
  
  Here we are testing various approaches to segment the customers using: K-Means, SpectralClustering, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN and K-Medoid.

  - Preprocessing: normalization, tuning,...
  - Select most important features to highlight the key criteria to segment the customers.
  - Visualization of cluster's key characterictics to understand the typology of customers.
  - Cluster Analysis based on distance between the centroids and statistical tests (Mann-Whitney) to check if all clusters are significant.
