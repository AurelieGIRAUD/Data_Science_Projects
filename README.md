# Portfolio


This portfolio is a compilation of projects I created for academic purpose and self learning. My focus is to deliver inspirational solutions to solve real-life business cases using data analysis and machine learning algorithms.
The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and scripts. 

✋ Data used in the projects are for demonstration purposes only.
✅ For a better UX experience, please check out [my GitHub page](https://aureliegiraud.github.io/).

# Machine Learning Applications

## Regression Analysis


- [Multiple Linear Regression apply to a Marketing Case Study](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Linear_Regression) - Describes how to apply a Multiple Linear Regression Model using Scipy and how to perform regression diagnosis to tackle uncertainties.
- [Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_Regression) - Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression.
- [Revenue Prediction with Linear Model and ANOVA](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/ANOVA) - An international bank hopes to find new customers. From existing data, build a model to analyze and predict the income of prospective clients.

## Clustering


- [Customer Segmentation based on Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Clustering) - Segmentation of customers based on their credit card utilization for improving Bank marketing strategy, using various clustering algorithm: K-Means, SpectralClustering, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN and K-Medoid.


# Data Pre-processing
- [Cleaning data with Fuzzy Wuzzy and Tkinter](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Cleaning_Fuzzy_TKinter.ipynb) - In a dataset with job application and recruiting data, with multiples columns corresponding to the same skills, we use Fuzzy Wuzzy to match similar names and Tkinter to improve the process of renaming and cleaning the whole set. We reduce by 40% the amount of data due to duplicates and mispelled values.
