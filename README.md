# Portfolio


This portfolio is a compilation of projects I created for academic purpose and self learning. My focus is to deliver inspirational solutions to solve real-life business cases using data analysis and machine learning algorithms.
The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and scripts. 

✋ Data used in the projects are for demonstration purposes only.
✅ For a better UX experience, please check out [my GitHub page](https://aureliegiraud.github.io/).

# Machine Learning Applications

## Regression Analysis


- [Multiple Linear Regression apply to a Marketing Case Study](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Linear_Regression) - Describes how to apply a Multiple Linear Regression Model using Scipy and how to perform regression diagnosis to tackle uncertainties.
- [Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_Regression) - Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression.
- [Revenue Prediction with Linear Model and ANOVA](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/ANOVA) - Predict the revenue of customer's children in order to target potential future customers, based on ANOVA and multiple linear regression models.

## Clustering


- [Customer Segmentation based on Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Clustering) - Segmentation of customers based on their credit card utilization for improving Bank marketing strategy, using various clustering algorithm: K-Means, SpectralClustering, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN and K-Medoid.
