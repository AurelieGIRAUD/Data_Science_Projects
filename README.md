# Machine Learning Applications
This is repository of data science projects, I have completed for academic, self learning or to solve real-life business cases.
The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and scripts. Data used in the projects are for demonstration purposes only.
For a better UX experience, please check out website.


1. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_Regression) - Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression.
2. [Clustering](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Clustering) - Segmentation of customers based on their credit card utilization for improving Bank marketing strategy, using various clustering algorithm: K-Means, SpectralClustering, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN and K-Medoid.
3. [ANOVA](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/ANOVA) - Predict the revenue of customer's children in order to target potential future customers, based on ANOVA and multiple linear regression models.
4. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Linear_Regression) - Describes how to apply a Multiple Linear Regression Model using Scipy and how to perform regression diagnosis to tackle uncertainties.
