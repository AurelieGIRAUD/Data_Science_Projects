# Detect counterfeit banknotes with logistic regression

### âœ… Business Case

In this project, we are creating a model to detect fake banknotes using a Logistic Regression algorithm and labelled data containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes. 


### ðŸ“‰ Dataset

This project was completed as a part of the [Data Analyst nanodegree](https://openclassrooms.com/en/dashboard/paths) displayed by Openclassrooms. 
The dataset is therefore provided by the platform as a part of the program.

  - Handling outliers
  - Data Visualizations supported by MatplotLib.
  
  2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
  - Scree Plot Analysis.
  - Loadings Plots.
  - Scores Plots.
  - Selection of the principal components.
  
  3) Logistic Regression
